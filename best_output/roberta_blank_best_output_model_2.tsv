The English name "Normans" comes from the French words Normans/Normanz, plural of Normant, modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann "Northman" or directly from Old Norse Norðmaðr, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean "Norseman, Viking"	When was the Latin version of the word Norman first recorded?	9th century	0	1
 Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s, but were divided between colonies in the east (Roumois and Pays de Caux) around the low Seine valley and in the west in the Cotentin Peninsula, and were separated by traditional pagii, where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers	When did Rollo begin to arrive in Normandy?	880s	1	1
 For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once	What type of machine is a computational model that is not allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once?	non-deterministic Turing machine	1	1
